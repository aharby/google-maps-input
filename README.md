# @sanity/google-maps-input [Fork]

```diff

+ This is for those who want to have the full address information besides the coordinates.
+so the input would be a normal geopoint, where the output is a geopoint plus formated address
+and address components provided by google places api.

+ This could be used for saving adresses in sanity.

+ It is quick and dirty, probably because I don't know better but it works and it's very useful if that's what you're looking for. 

- Disabled: Setting the location by dragging or clicking on the map.

## Know issues in Studio V3

* Diff-preview is not implemented.

These will be re-added well before Studio V3 GA.

## Installation

[here](https://github.com/aharby/google-maps-input/edit/main/README.md#installation)

<del>
In your studio folder, run:

```
npm install --save @sanity/google-maps-input@studio-v3
```

or

```
yarn add @sanity/google-maps-input@studio-v3
```
</del>
## Usage

Add it as a plugin in sanity.config.ts (or .js), with a valid [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key):

```js
import { googleMapsInput } from "@sanity/google-maps-input";

export default createConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
      googleMapsInput({
          apiKey: "my-api-key"
     })
  ] 
})
```
Ensure that the key has access to:
* Google Maps JavaScript API
* Google Places API Web Service
* Google Static Maps API

And that the key allows web-access from the Studio URL(s) you are using the plugin in. 

Note: This plugin will replace the default `geopoint` input component.
